And so, it's an appropriate moment to recall what they are. So are you writing a report for this? Sorry. I'm getting... Thanks. Habiro It so hard to remember Okay so there are basically two sides to this story and on the left I will put some of the things from last term and the right from this term So for me the motivation in defining these things was some expectations starting from around 2017 or so that there is some such a neuro cohomology and I will use this I use this lecture to explain what I mean by this. And these Habiro rings of number fields are basically the zero-dimensional case. If your variety is just a bunch of points in some sense, then you get these Habiro rings of number fields. So there is some kind of abstract idea of what these things should be. And last time I was talking about something much more concrete. So there were certain q related to perturbative confinement theory whatever that is But these q-theories were completely explicit, so they were very explicit approach, Which actually defines elements in there. The abstract approach produces the ring or module, this concrete approach will choose elements in there. And this abstract side also got started maybe a little later, Here we have someone coming from the computer science department at Galois-Falides and Zagildit. And then we talked to each other and realized that there is this interesting common object of interest. And this led to our paper. And at that time I was actually thinking that I didn believe in this expectation anymore but then they found element in there and just revived the expectation and then my student Ferdinand Wagner tried to see whether such a thing exists and at first his master thesis proved no but now his PhD thesis proves yes So it's a very confusing state of affairs and part of the goal of this course is to somehow understand what's going on, although that will still be confusing. So this half was the last term and this was the next term. And there have been also some developments that bring these two sides, which so far just give rise to one common object. These sides seem to converge more and maybe or maybe not, I will say something about what's happening in the relation between these two things. But mostly these are disjoint things that just happen to overlap in certain objects. And so for this reason you don't"

So roughly the goal of this Habiro cohomology of this course is to define some new explicit cohomology theories. for algebraic varieties. that is not one thing but that has extremely many specializations to classical theories. So it specializes to to usual the Rham cohomology but also p etale for all p and also crystalline for and also prismatic quality it's even better, it's not just for algebraic varieties actually even for Richardson's varieties \u989c\u6c0f \u989c\u6c0f \u989c\u6c0f \u989c\u6c0f \u989c\u6c0f \u989c\u6c0f So related to the Q-Pocher-Massimo that appeared throughout the last term. And historically speaking I should say that I found this new cohomology theory because after the last course I was kind of very inspired by all these computations with q and spent the whole break computing and at some point I could arrange the formulas to make some abstract sense to me \u9806\u4fbf\u4ecb\u7d39\u4e00\u4e0b\u9019\u5e7e\u500b\u984c\u76ee\u3002 Alright, so let me give some explanation of how you should think about this. \u9806\u4fbf\u4ecb\u7d39\u4e00\u4e0b\u9019\u5e7e\u500b\u984c\u76ee\u3002 Let me talk a little bit about some of the state of the art regarding cohomologies. \u9806\u4fbf\u4ecb\u7d39\u4e00\u4e0b\u9019\u5e7e\u500b\u984c\u76ee\u3002 And I usually always consider a way of like things. So satisfying a particular Kuhn formula. So you want, for simplicity let's say you start with the same K in all the directly closed fields. What kind of cohomology do I want So I want something that takes some that separates teams of finite types or something like this something exist\u9019\u6a23\u5b50 you have so C\u043a\u0438\u0435 PD These needs It should phase into And one thing I always want is that it satisfies the standard formula. So this excludes certain absolute cohomology series like no typical cohomology series. And this is like the minimal structure I want. A better structure I'm usually really looking for is some kind of six-factor formalism. And, in this case, he would rather upgrade this one category to another, and for animal separated schemes of finite type, over K, have some kind of derived category, a functor going to the left or right."

As you will see, it's not satisfied all the standard examples. So really this is a kind of, what I would regard as a really structured, really structured cohomology sequence. So what are the known examples for this So this is a picture I always like to draw my favorite picture which you can also find at my office door So this picture has two spec Z-directions, and one I usually know by L, and another I think knows by T. \u2039The part that needs to discribe the whole dispensation system is the survey part again.\u203a And one day I be drawing a PL That will put such a cohomology theory For varieties with the characteristics of K as K That was one characteristic of the geometry I am working with and coefficients for the string A characteristic S So what are the standard examples? The most classical is the one which takes an x which lives over the complex numbers to just a singular cohomology of x. So in this case A would be Z. If you want a quintet formula you should pay some attention to doing everything derived. But let's do that. And this even upgrades to a sheeps theory, which is that any X associated with the derived affinity category of B and sheep are X. And for some reason arithmetic geometrists started calling this not singular but betting cohomology And this is as an island gets So this defines the full six formalism and even satisfies the quidditch formula It a categorical level not just a simple level of cohomology \u989c\u8272\u662f\u4e00\u822c\u7684,\u4f46\u6211\u5c1a\u672a\u8bd5\u8fc7\u3002 So in this picture, what does it give you? Well, you work with the complex numbers here, so the characteristic is 0, so you might think it's a generic one, but really because it's really using the complex topology or something like that to put this alchimedian infinity. But the coefficients, they can be anything, they can be the integers, They can be integers, but they can also be any field with any characteristics, so this gives you the whole line here. So singular cohomology, or vector cohomology, gives you a whole line here. What are other examples?"

And there is also a corresponding six-factor formula which takes any X to D modules on X, which again satisfies the Kuhnert formula. \u989c\u8272\u5723\u5b50 \u989c\u8272\u5723\u5b50 \u989c\u503c \u989c\u503c \u989c\u503c and then compare isomorphism between singular cohomology, which it tends up to C, and the Rham cohomology of x one year over C. These two things become isomorphic. And not just that, but even more, you also have a corresponding statement at the level of sheaves, which is known as the Riemann-Hiller correspondence. I don't have space to write this, but I mean, the statement at the level of effective spaces is also mirrored by a corresponding statement comparing sheaves series between T-modules and vector sheaves in this case. So right Then the third example this was Grogan big realisation that you can define a cohomology which is how formalism of sites and so on was developed. So here, x lives over k, and l is any prime that's different from the characteristic of k. \u55ef And then you have to take the Hodge homology groups. \u55ef Which of X, and you can either just take Z mod L coefficients or you could also take Z mod L to the NG coefficients. \u55ef And again there's also corresponding Sheaf series which takes any X to the graph category of Hodge-Stevenson X with Z mod L. \u989c\u548c And again, so what does this give you in this? Ah one comment I wanted to make here is that it how comorbid stuff satisfies the Kinnett formula but if you are asking for this at the categorical level then this does not satisfy the Kinnett formula So it is not quite as nice as the other sheaf theories In this picture, what does it give you? When L is equal to 2, then it gives you a cohomology theory as long as your geometry is not in characteristic 2. You can do this mod 2 but also mod 1 sometimes a slightly thickened line here. And again pictorially this thing meets this Betti line here and again this is substantiated by some deep mathematics which tells you that there's a comparison theorem between a topomorphic and singular form. out this comparison and summarizing and again there"

So in particular, there's also some corresponding sheaf theory. This took much longer to develop. There's work of Berthelot, Caro, and many people, and I'm not quite an expert on this story, but there's something called arithmetic demodules on X. And for the versions that are in the literature I not quite sure whether they would satisfy the categorical quinn formula maybe they do maybe they don I just didn check it But I know that there are versions of this construction which might not exactly agree with the things that are in the literature but which do satisfy this categorical quinnit formula After 2 yrs, I gave Tonka the dom' stuff, where I explained one probability for such a problem. shan \u03bf\u03b9 ch'sia  Had the team prick 2.\u6703 review relies on 2 shan mourning cleaning ginsenghi contituul\u3093\u30683 veit bag209 and the restoration of aguijen.

So with managing speaking, when you have a scheme that lives in this characteristic, so it's with zp, We have some of the crystalline cohomology of the special fiber over Zp. We have the Rham cohomology of X over Zp and we have the Etal cohomology of X base changed to t bar of z equal to t I think I keep to the end but then it gonna be not so easy And there was a question how are these related? This became the subject known as p-adic Hodge theory. So note that both the kind of how they are defined is very different, and the kind of structure that they have is very different. So for example, crystalline cohomology this carries the Frobenius action equals everything. Coming from characteristic P carries the Frobenius, so it means H is acting on X. The Rham cohomology comes with its extra structure which is a Hodge filtration. And this also has an extra structure which is an action of the absolute power group. So there is a very different definition very different structures that suggested that they should really still fit into one framework And so then, first Fontaine found some conjectural picture of what's going on. So he probably did some comparison of these conjectures. How these different things are related. For example, in this situation, my next is proper and smooth. From ten-word conjecture that if you take this crystalline cohomology and tensor it up to this certain ring known as B-cryst, then its isomorphic, sorry, tritarchal, then it will have to be B-cryst, compatible with all the extra structures. So it turns out that B-cryst amounts to all the three kinds of extra structures. Frobenius has a Gaula action it has a filtration and so then in some of the forms in the tensor product you get induced structures here and some on the other side so it compatible with Frobenius filtration And these conjectures were then successively proved, in particular by Fautings and Tzuji. But then, and some kind of slightly auxiliary kind of cohomology theories were defined in the process. \u4f46\u6709\u4e9b\u5fae\u5fae\u7684,\u6709\u4e9b\u5fae\u5fae\u7684,\u6709\u4e9b\u5fae\u5fae\u7684,\u6709\u4e9b\u5fae\u5fae\u7684, \u9806\u4fbf\u4ecb\u7d39\u4e00\u4e0b\u6700\u7279\u5225\u7684\u3002 I will introduce the ones that really just specialize to all the others. \u5148\u4ecb\u7d39\u4e00\u4e0b\u6700\u7279\u5225\u7684\u3002"

For the moment I'm slightly confused about how to connect this to Hodge theory, so let me not quite connect it there yet. And as I said, this was somehow connecting, the prismatic cohomology was already connecting this into the CETAR branch. In some sense, this new theory was likely spread further over the CETAR branch. Not quite everywhere, but further than the prismatic cohomology was saying. This log script here is supposed to be the central cohomology. We're unifying quite a lot of different cohomology theories into one. And so what's the starting point for trying to find this theory? The starting point is an interesting example of such a prism So there is something known as the q Rham prism This is given by the ring A being the equal power series of q-1 to q-1. So this A is some kind of p-adic complete ring and it's also supposed to have the Frobenius acting on it. The Frobenius will just be the thing that tends q to the t power of q. Kind of obvious Frobenius lift we have here. And then this ideal i is a certain principal ideal. There are some properties, but in this case it will just be the one generated by the q deformation of the element p. What is a q So this is a prism where the corresponding quotient, \u863fi, is mutated in order by the q-deformation of p, also known as the p-psychotomic polynomial. So then you just get an extension of the IP region in this case. In particular, for any variety X over this ring, you will have some It's really cohomology and it can try to compute lots of this. And, just a spot for a moment. You can just try to see what you get and so in the background we have some of this very abstract machine computing with prismatic cohomology but then you just try to make it explicit in the simplest case and so you try to compute with cohomology the simplest case of this ZEP uppermilion over this thing in this right\u30a2t sproutok of the skew of an algorithm \ufffd\"? \u9806\u4fbf\u770b\u4e0b,\u6211\u5148\u8b1b\u4e00\u4e0b\u9019\u6bb5\u97f3\u6a02\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u3002 \u7136\u5f8c\u4f60\u6703\u767c\u73fe,\u9019\u500b\u6771\u897f\u662f\u7528Q-deformation of the Derivative to compute. \u4e4b\u5f8c\u4f60\u6703\u767c\u73fe,\u9019\u500b\u6771\u897f\u662f\u7528Q-deformation of the Derivative to compute. \u9019\u5c31\u662f\u4e00\u500b\u5f88\u660e\u986f\u7684Q-deformation of the Derivative. \u9019\u662f\u4e00\u500b\u5f88\u660e\u986f\u7684Q-deformation of the Derivative.

And in slightly more varying terms, if you have any function n of x here, then you're sending it here to... So there is a difference of q divided by q But you don take the limit as q goes to 1 So q is somehow close to 1 but you still retain the whole policy of And so I still remember very very well when I first did this computation, actually we did this to the context of the Zane cohomology, and I was just completely confused what the q is doing there, and why q-definitions appear.

And, I mean, until today I don't really understand what's going on, but I'm trying to understand this phenomenon better and better. \u989c\u503c So just to give an indication that something very strange is happening here This cohomology theory is supposed to be functorial of course in automorphism in particular of your variety so you can just change the coordinate of x to some other coordinate, like 1-x or x plus 1 or t minus 1 times x or whatever, and then it must act on this cohomology because it's functorial. But if you try to write down in coordinates what this coordinate transformation does, it's totally unclear. Because if you change the coordinate at x, then the meaning of this q-difference quotient just changes completely, because the q-difference quotient is about the values of x and at q times x. But if you don't take the limit as q goes to 1, there's some random point somewhere else. This is the automorphism of sending x times q to q times x is not invariant under the coordinate transformations. So the very fact that the cohomology of this complex or even this complex of the quasi is independent of choices of coordinates is not at all clear On the other hand, the good news about this computation is that for this kind of quest of Of finding something that's uniform in P here, I mean this Q-deformation looks great because, I mean there's an obvious way to write down such a complex that doesn't depend on P, I just remove the P everywhere. Except that there's somewhere that P is root of unity and also that this Q-deformation of P thing is a little bit of a special rule there, so actually if you look at the details of this then it becomes a bit confusing, but in first approximation, Like, defining this q-de Rham context is something that you can perfectly well do in the Kennedy of P.

Using the over R to rationalize R and then take for a different one. However, this idyllic gluing that you're doing here feels a little bit artificial. It can be made to work, but the pieces, they don't quite seem to fit together. I mean, you can still make them fit together, but it's a little bit awkward. In particular, I'm not quite sure whether this idyllic gluing works well enough that you could also make a series of coefficients out of this. I've never fully tried. This is only at the level of cohomology groups and there hasn't been developed a real theory of coefficients. In the prismatic theory there is a good theory of coefficients that would also satisfy a pretty good group. And probably we can also make it work here Okay so you get this canonical information of the hypothesis in human as well And this raises the obvious question. So let me give an example for this. So, maybe the most favorite example is the Legendre family of elliptic curves. \u989c\u5f64 So here R must be zeno to n lambda, and then you convert lambda to 1 minus lambda. \u989c\u5f64 So here R must be zeno to n lambda, and then you convert lambda to 1 minus lambda. \u989c\u5f64 And x over R will be the elliptic curve for safety linear invert to with f models y squared equals x times X minus 1 times X minus 1 then So, the first round cohomology, X over R is free of rank 2. And inside there it has a Hodge filtration, right? So in particular it has the first piece of Hodge filtration, which is global differentials. And there is actually some kind of canonical global differential \u03a9, which is dx over y. \u9884\u4e66\u7406\u89e3, and this has a correction. \u9884\u4e66\u7406\u89e3, and this has a correction. \u9884\u4e66\u7406\u89e3, and this has a correction."

So, in the case of the Rham cohomology, you didn't just have a module with a connection, but you also had a canonical vector in there. I mean, at least up to scaling, you didn't have this piece of logical iteration. And then you can look at the kind of differential equation that this class satisfies leading to this explicit equation here But if you want to go from just a module modulus connection to an actual equation you need to find a vector in there And so if I want to find some kind of... if I want to use my q-deformation of the Rham cohomology to produce a q-deformation of the equation, then I should find a vector inside the q-de Rham cohomology. And from my abstract machinery I just have no means of producing vectors in the Q-deformation of the Rham cohomology. The other issue, more psychological, is that there is a certain mismatch here, in that the Q-deformation of the Rham cohomology only is something defined in power series in Q-1. And from the way it's constructed, these power series in q-1 feel extremely important to me. I really, I mean I would love to have something that's defined more like Rham polynomials in q, but for various reasons this seems impossible. On the other hand, if you look at this explicit series here, then the q-different equation that it satisfies, it don't need the power series in q-1, it really just has coefficients which are like Rham polynomials in q-1. The nature of the skewed information would seem to indicate that really the skewed information of the Rham cohomology shouldn just be defined after Poisson cumulus one but really running over the Rham polynomials And to this day I can reconcile that, and I think there is something very serious going on. But this question seems to have a very positive answer. So there's a paper of Xi Rai, from which I was copying a couple of the formulas here, going back to 2020 or something like this, where he was already proving some versions of this. And more recently, there's something much more systematic about finding classes in this q-de Rham cohomology. There's some kind of general proposal for how to do this. Like Rho per unit and B by R. Still on corporate, but... A lot of good evidence here. I still don't really understand what's going on, but... The answer does seem to have a clear... It seems to be a clear yes They seem to have a method for constructing passes in this view. And so once you have a method for finding classes in there, then again you can look which two different equations that satisfy and then someone gets explicit equations again. And this is related to what I was beginning my lecture today, that was this kind of explicit half and the abstract half, and we are focusing on the abstract half, but then there is again this explicit half, which is about finding actual elements. She writes into this very particular example."

This previous conjecture that I just erased and that was proved by Wagner, it's just about what happens when q is near 1, but we can ask more generally what happens when q is close to a limit of unity Not just one And I mean often extending from q equals 1 to any rule of unity is somewhat formal but in this case it's manifestly not. So in particular, the most naive expectation of what could happen turns out to be false. And so... Are we also supposed to think of q deformations of Fontaine's rings? Well, no, the Fontaine's rings already have a q in them, right? Ah, so, yeah. So they are also skewed around to the prism, and this maps to, for example, Fontaine's period ring A \u03a9, so this Witt vector is of the tilde of O , in natural white, and that's it, while sending q to this element touching the ellipse of where is the same coming from compatible systems So Fontaine rings kind of already have the q in them But you have to verify that this conjecture is true right That after extension of the May not appear obvious because it usually limited by more than 40 chiaras Less hibernation means less deixarola oriquement of the moments.

Worked with this ring called H, curly H, so distinguished from homology groups, which is a composition of Pro-economics in Q, that are all root of Neody, and one way to do this is to take the 1 minus Q to the M and have a completion function and then take a limit over all m. The way it usually written by people studying Q is that it you combine this into one limit just over m and you take the quotient by Q proximate to Q Where recall in general So it's a product of one of my previous videos. No, I found one today. So it's some kind of Q factorial. These two systems are co-final to each other. \u55ef So there's an abstract reason and a concrete reason for looking at this type of ring. The abstract reason for me was that if you look at prismatic cohomology, then for generic parameters q, this seems to be a somewhat random thing, but when you specialize to a p-part root of unity, which is somehow p-added distal close to 1, \u55ef Then this seems to again"

So within their story of all these q-series, there seems to be some part that even defines typical wrong polynomial, but much more is defined with Habiro ring, so it's good to try it there, on the first class. of d value suffix impl Isaiah particle So when I gave the first talk about this conjecture about the existence of this q Rham cohomology someone in the audience immediately asked whether this would not be even defined over the Sabiro ring not just over the q completion but over all roots of unity I believe I already had this question at the back of my mind then, but certainly after this question was asked I thought more seriously about this. And for like zero-dimensional varieties it's easy enough to put up some kind of definition of what the Habiro cohomology should be for like a zero-dimensional proper smooth scheme, also known as a finite-term algebra, which is the Habiro ring of the number field, but in higher dimensions I convinced myself that it cannot possibly work. What is the issue? The problem is that if you look at this prismatic cohomology with the two Rham systems, Which is the correct answer theoretically Then this behaves differently depending on whether q is equal to 1 or q is a non p with unity So when you specialize to q equal to 1 you get the Rham cohomology cohomology But when you specialize to q equal to zeta p to the n when n is positive, \u4f60\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8eq1,\u5f53n\u662fp\u5230n,\u5f53n\u662fpositive, you get some slightly twisted version but basically Hodge cohomology. \u4f60\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u662f\u6709\u70b9\u6df7\u4e71\u7684,\u57fa\u672c\u4e0a\u662fHodge cohomology\u3002 In particular, if you invert p, you will just get the direct sum of Hodge cohomology groups. \u5982\u679c\u4f60\u53cd\u904e\u4f86,\u4f60\u6703\u5f97\u5230\u5927\u5c0f\u5fa9\u4ef0\u7684\u5fa9\u4ef0\u3002 And this is bad because whenever you're trying to do something without a Bure ring, \u4f60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u56e0\u70ba\u4f60\u5617\u8a66\u505a\u4e00\u4e9b\u4e0d\u6b63\u5e38\u7684\u5fa9\u4ef0, you're meant to treat all roots of unity the same. \u4f60\u61c9\u8a72\u8981\u8ddf\u4e00\u7a2e\u5fa9\u4ef0\u5fa9\u4ef0\u7684\u5fa9\u4ef0\u4e00\u6a23\u3002 \u989c\u503c Come on, technically, like if you... someone specialized first to a piece rule of unity, then you can define something integrally, but then if you go more to a different prime L, then what used to happen at a piece rule of unity should be more related to what happens at a piece rule of unity. Anyway so you can try to cook up something but you will run into the issue that these roots of unity behave differently to your homology Sorry can I recall if you mean roughly by Hodge cohomology It's a Hodge take-say. There's some small take-says. But if you invert p, it's just a very small Hodge cohomology. \u55ef... Alright, so... But in dimension zero, the issue disappears. \u55ef... Alright, so...

I have a question. Can you hear me? Yes, we can hear you. So in your paper you mentioned this issue that was with the computation of the The of the arithmetic curve that you in fact cannot specialize a lambda to be any figures of 0 and 1 that are prescribed by the equation And in light of this new theory, can you compute the theorem of cohomology of a singular arithmetic curve? \u989c\u6b63\u5370\u8c61\u4f60\u4e2a\u4e0d\u4f1a FIFACC\u4e00\u8fb9.\u554a McKinley,\u52a0\u4e00\u6b21 refin attention, southeast fair. \u989c\u6b63\u5370\u8c61\u4f60\u4e2a\u4e0d\u4f1a FIFACC\u4e00\u8fb9.\u554a McKinley,\u0e2a\u0e27\u0e31\u6b62\u0e29\u0e10 RNAI,\u52a0\u4e00\u6b21 rein attention Later on, wha life is different between most ek Prof., Good question. I would have to think The thing is that when you do for example prismatic cohomology you don't just specify your basemes but you also need to specify the surrounding prism. And so this makes prismatic cohomology only functional in maps of prisms but not just maps of rings. So even if you know what the Q-deformation of the Rham cohomology is for this universe, I mean for the whole of the Rham family, This is just the fixed prism surrounding this which fix the coordinate lambda And then if you want to specialize the particular value of lambda He This is actually fun, so I will write down a very explicit ring stack, so it's some kind of algebraic or analytic stack, which itself has a structure of a ring, so you can multiply and add elements. And the multiplication will be kind of easy to describe, but the addition will be extremely complicated to describe.
