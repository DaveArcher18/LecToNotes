And so, actually, I think for most of today, maybe all of today, we'll actually even more assume that $X$ is just equal to $\\mathbb{A}^{d}$, or $\\mathbb{G}_{m}^{d}$. And then, in the next step, we will see how to extend the discussion from just the space changes and get the $\\tau$ over it. But on the first part, let's really just focus on the simplification. And so, one thing that happens in this case is that we don't actually have to do any completions. In this case, we can somehow define what is a spherical model. I do not want to make any claims, and something definitely false, that this would be independent of coordinates, but at least if you choose coordinates, you would be able to write it down. So, let's get started. So, we have these two derivatives. Which go from the $i$, which refers to an index, that's one of the coordinates, and goes from the algebra that we're working with, but you join $q$. And what does it do? Well, it's basically the same formula as for the derivative, except you have to define it just to define it as a monomial. So, you take product $x_{1}$ to the $n_{1}$, so $x_e$ to the $n_v$, and well, usually you would get $x_{1}$ to the $n_{1}$, and then for $x_i$ you take $1$, and then $e$ to the $n_v$, and you multiply by $n_i$, and for this $q$ derivative, simply $q$ to the $4$. Where, I recall that since there's a $q$-deformation of any integer $n$, $1 - q$ to the $n$ is $1 - q$. So, this is a different, more close to one formula for what this $q$ derivative is, except if you apply it to a function of $x$.\n\n#### Segment (00_{1}0_{0}0 to 00_{1}5_{0}0)\n\nSo, the $q$ is always somewhat treated as a constant in the background, and the $x$ is, oh sorry, I called it $t$. It's the same way you take $f$ of these things, but $c_i$ you multiply by $q$, and then you subtract the volume at the original spot. And then you divide by the different doses. And so you immediately see that this $\\nabla_i^q$ is closely related. So, the automorphism $\\gamma_i$ from $x$ to $x$, which sends any $t_j$ to either $t_j$, where $t_j$ is not equal to $i$, but in coordinate $i$, multiplied by $t$. So, this $\\gamma_i$ of $x$ is equal to $i q$. So, some basic facts about these $q$ derivatives are that the $\\nabla_i^q$, they commute. However, be aware that they do not satisfy the Leibniz rule, since they satisfy a certain $q$-deformation of the Leibniz rule. So, if you apply it to a product, then you would expect that it's $f$ times the $q$ derivative of $g$, plus $g$ times the $q$ derivative of $f$. But that's not true, it's not a derivation. Instead, you need to put $\\gamma_i$ in one of these terms, and you're somehow free to choose where. So, this $q$-deformation of the Leibniz rule in particular breaks the symmetry a little bit, because this side was obviously asymmetric in $f$ and $g$, this side doesn't look like it's symmetric. All right, let's see right now. And so, using this you can then write down a $q$-deformation of the Sideron complex. I think in some form this goes back to the work of our mentor, and I mean maybe it should do."

And endowing that fully faithfully into our modules is a modified connection. I'm not saying anything deep here, but the central image, those $m$, which are still $Q - 1 + 1$, and such that if you take this modified $Q$ connection and mod it by $Q - 1$, you're supposed to get zero. This is just a condition that I can reverse the dividing by $Q - 1$. And now we have a tangent here, given just by this kind of naive procedure, symmetric tangent here. And then you just check that it preserves the socket. If you tangent two $Q - 1$ times the three modules together, it's still $Q - 1$ times the three modules together. And then some of this condition of being zero mod $Q - 1$. In this picture, it's saying that in the Wolfson's $\\gamma_i$'s, as they reduce to the identity, the sum of all is preserved.\n\n### Modified $Q$ Connections\n\nAll right. So in the end, we will care about these modified $Q$ connections. And so at least if the parents of these modules plus these systems. Right. And so the question is, to what extent are these modules rather strange? So let's look at the case where $X$ is just $\\mathbb{G}_m^d$. Then for generic $Q$, these modules modify $Q$ connection. They're really some kind of pros and cons on $\\mathbb{G}_m \\mod Q$ to the $d$. Because this $\\gamma_i$'s act by multiplication by $Q$ on the coordinates. And then this data of these endomorphisms, it would really give you just a descent to this kind of quotient stack here. But I mean, we want that this can be somewhat functorial in any possible maps of $X$ and also like if you pass to open subsets of $Q$. So what is this object? $\\mathbb{G}_m$ going by $Q$ to $\\mathbb{Z}$. What kind of object? I mean, I'm probably just thinking about this as the FPQC quotient of $\\mathbb{G}_m$ by the action of $Q$ to the $\\mathbb{Z}$. I'm not sure it's so helpful to think of this as a geometric object. I mean, later on we will consider some stacks which are some variants of this. I mean, if you\n\n### Simplification of the Model\n\nThe lecture focuses on the simplification of a mathematical model, assuming $X = \\mathbb{A}^d$ or $\\mathbb{G}_m^d$. In this case, completions are not necessary, and a spherical model can be defined, although its coordinate-independence is not claimed. The discussion revolves around two derivatives, which map from an index $i$ (referring to an algebra) to $q$. The $q$-derivative is defined as a monomial, similar to the standard derivative formula, but with $q^{4}$ instead of $n_i$. The $q$-deformation of an integer $n$ is recalled, where $1 - q^n$ is equal to $1 - q$: these concepts are crucial in understanding the $q$-derivative's application to functions of $x$.\n\n### Properties of $q$-Derivatives\n\nThe lecture discusses the properties of $q$-derivatives, specifically the $\\nabla_{i,q}$, which is closely related to the automorphism $\\gamma_i$ from $x$ to $x$. The $q$-derivatives commute, but they do not satisfy the Leibniz rule, instead, they satisfy a $q$-deformation of the Leibniz rule, which breaks the symmetry in the product rule. This $q$-deformation involves inserting $\\gamma_i$ in one of the terms, allowing for a choice of where to place it. The lecture also touches on the $q$-deformation of the Sideron complex, which has roots in the work of the mentor.\n\n### $q$-Derived Complex\n\nThe lecture revisits the concept of $q$-derivatives, tracing back to Jackson's work in the early 20th century and further developed by the mentor. The $q$-derived complex is constructed by applying the $q$-derivative in all directions. However, a peculiar phenomenon arises: the Sideron complex, typically a commutative algebra, fails to satisfy the Leibniz rule due to the $q$-derivative's non-standard behavior. This anomaly can be addressed by working in an associative setting, treating the $q$-derivatives as bimodules, but this approach is not commutative. The lecturer hints at a potential resolution, which will be revisited later, possibly in the context of the garage infinity category, where a canonical commutative ring structure exists.\n\n### Modified $q$-Derivative\n\nThe lecture discusses the $q$-derived complex, which is constructed by applying the $q$-derivative in all directions. However, the Sideron complex, typically a commutative algebra, fails to satisfy the Leibniz rule due to the $q$-derivative's non-standard behavior. This anomaly can be addressed by working in an associative setting, treating the $q$-derivatives as bimodules, but this approach is not commutative. The lecturer introduces a modified version of the $q$-derivative, $Q - 1$ times the $q$-derivative, which omits the factor of dividing by $Q - 1$. This modified version will be used to make the complex independent of coordinates."

So ... maybe I don't want to continue this discussion right now because there are only 15 minutes left. I should maybe rather do something, explain something else in the remaining few minutes. So, prior to today I told you about two things associated to $X$. One kind of cohomology is the round complex or the $QH$ complex. And then about some categories. Actually, the category knows about the cohomology. So, to hear the propositions. So, the $QH$ complex computes the direct and the morphisms of the unit in the direct category. And the $QH$ complex. So, the $QH$ complex computes the unit in the direct category. So, the problem with this is the thing I said previously that these things have canonical, derived commutative ring structures. Because whenever you have any kind of symmetric monoidal category, then the morphisms of the unit become an infinity. Sorry, is it clear that these subcategories are also stable or derived, or triangulated? These subcategories. Because you take all $\\mathbb{Z}$ adjoining $Q$ plus minus one $T$ underscore modules, you consider the sub-objects which have $Q$ connection. No, I mean, I literally take the BN category of modules with such a sub-$Q$ connection and then I take the raw categories. But I know that this subcategory of modules is still a BN. It's not a subcategory, right? Because sub-$Q$ connection has a lot of extra data. But yeah, I think it's quite reasonably BN category, right? So, if you have a map of these things, it must be kernel, core kernel, and whatnot. It again has these two connection structures.\n\n## Lecture Historical Context\n### Summary 1\nSummary generation failed.
