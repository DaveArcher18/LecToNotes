You don't have to know what they are, and sometimes I didn't really discuss them all that much in the course. So I will talk to you in a moment if you recall what they are. So are you running an argument on purpose? Sorry, I'm getting... Thanks. So there are basically two sides to this story, and on the left I will put some of the things from last term and the right from this term. So for me the motivation in defining these things was some expectations starting from around 2017 or so that there is some such a miracle in cohomology. And I will use this lecture to explain what I mean by this. And these Sabiro rings of numbers fields are basically the zero-dimensional case. Your variety is just a bunch of points in some sense. Then you get Sabiro rings of numbers fields. So there is some kind of abstract idea of what these things should be. And last time I was talking about something much more concrete. So there were certain Q-Series related to perturbative transformers theory, whatever that is. But these Q-Series were completely explicit, and so they were having a very explicit approach which actually defines elements in there. So the abstract approach produces the ring or the module. This concrete approach will produce two elements in there. And this abstract side also got started maybe a little later, someone coming from computations that Gavr Faldides and Zagir did. And then somehow we talked to each other and realized that there is this interesting common object of interest, and this led to our paper. And at that time I was actually thinking that I didn't believe in this expectation anymore. But then they found elements in there and just revived this expectation. And then my student, Fagin and Wagner, tried to see whether such a thing exists. And at first his master's thesis proved no, but now his PhD thesis proves yes. So it's a very confusing state of affairs, and part of the goals, of course, is to somehow understand what's going on. Although that will still be confusing. So this was somehow this half of the last term. And there have been also some developments that somehow bring these two sides, which so far just gave rise to one common object. These sides seem to converge more, and maybe or maybe not I will say something about what's happening with the relation between these two sides. But mostly these are disjoint things that just happen to overlap in certain objects. So for this reason you don't...",
    "summary": "Here is a two-paragraph summary of the transcript segment:\n\nThe lecture discusses the connection between two approaches to understanding certain algebraic structures. The first approach, related to Sabiro rings of number fields, is an abstract method that produces a ring or module. This approach is motivated by expectations in cohomology, which were revived by the discovery of explicit elements in these structures. The second approach, which was discussed in a previous course, involves concrete Q-series related to perturbative topological field theory. These two approaches, though distinct, have converged in recent developments, leading to a deeper understanding of the underlying algebraic objects.\n\nAdded motivation: The significance of these concepts lies in their potential to reveal deeper connections between cohomology and topological field theory. The abstract approach, rooted in cohomological expectations, has led to the discovery of explicit elements, which in turn have revived interest in the field. The convergence of the two approaches has important implications for our understanding of the algebraic structures underlying these theories. The ongoing research in this area, as exemplified by the speaker's student's PhD thesis, continues to shed light on the intricate relationships between these mathematical objects, driving the field forward."

    "content": "have to watch lectures from last year. So roughly the goal of the sabiural cohomology of this course is to define some new explicit cohomology of algebraic varieties So that's one thing, but that has extremely many specializations to critical theories. So it specializes to usual Dirham cohomology, but also Peelig et al. co-op, and also crystalline co-op. And superposition is also a cosmetic form. And it's even better, it's not just algebraic varieties. So it works in very large generality, it has very good structural properties. And what were connected to the last course is that the construction is in some sense based on certain very explicit Q-series. So related to the Q-pochhammer symbol that appeared throughout the last term. And historically speaking, I should say that I found this new cohomology theory because after the last course I was very inspired in all these computations with Q-series and spent the whole break computing and at some point I could arrange the formulas to make some abstract sense to me. Alright, so let me give some explanation of how you should think about this. So let me talk a little bit about some of the state of the art regarding cohomology theories. And I usually always consider wheels like things. So satisfying in particular the Cunin formula. For simplicity let's say we start with the same K naught, but I can choose Q. What kind of cohomology theory do I want? So I want something that takes some, that separates teams of finite types or something like this. And then you should land in some category of A-modules for something A. And this should have the usual functions. And one thing I always want is that it satisfies the Cunin formula. So this excludes certain absolute cohomology theories like a typical cohomology theory. And this is like the minimal structure I want. A better structure I'm usually really looking for is some kind of six-factor formalism. So in this case it would rather upgrade to this one categorical level. And for animal-separated teams of finite types...",

So which to any x associates some kind of derived category of sheaves over x. And really, again, I'm not going to go into too much detail here. I'm just going to give you a few examples. And really, again, I would like to, just to be really nice in particular, I would like to say that this again satisfies the Cunin formula, which can also be created at the categorical level. But this is rather stringent assumption. As we will see, it's not satisfied in all the standard examples. So really, this is kind of what I would regard as a really structured formalism. So what are the known examples of this? So this is a picture I always like to draw, my favorite picture, which you can also find at my office store. So this picture has two specZ directions. And one I usually note by L, and another I usually note by P. Where this is specZ and first approximation to the line where the points are the prime numbers. And then maybe there's also some kind of a comedian point in the theory. And so you have to make a picture like that. And one way I will be drawing a PL, then I will put such a cohomology theory for varieties over K with a characteristic of KST. So K denotes the kind of characteristic of the geometry I'm working with. And coefficients for the string A are characteristic of K. So what are the standard examples? The most typical is the one which takes an X which looks over the complex numbers to just a singular cohomology of X. So in this case A would be Z, and if you want to create a formula you should pay some attention to doing everything derived. But let's do that. And this even upgrades to a sheep theory which is to any X associated with the right category of P and sheep size. And for some reason arithmetic geometers started calling this not singular but betting cohomology. And this is as an idle guess. So this defines a full six-factor formula and even satisfies a qubit formula. It's a categorical level, not just a single cohomology. So in this picture, what does it give you? Well, you work with the complex numbers here, so the characteristic is zero. So you might think it's a generic point that really because it's really using the complex topology, it's a multi-archimedean place, which really puts it like an archimedean infinity. But the coefficients, they can be anything. They can be integers, but they could also be any few of any characteristics. So this gives you the whole line here. Thank you for watching.",

And if I want things to be nice, I should assume it's of characteristic zero. So to some extent, it works even in any characteristic, but then it depends maybe on what kind of X you have. But what it gives you is again a K-axis space. And there's also a corresponding six-factor formula, which takes any X to D modules on X, which again satisfies a qubit formula. And so with some small caveats, when you're positive characteristics, it basically gives you a whole diagonal line here because whatever you are, your geometry is in characteristic P, also your coefficients are in characteristic P. The same characteristics, which is diagonally in this picture. And just pictorially, those two lines just meet at infinity comma infinity. And this is actually substantiated. And it is substantiated by the comparison isomorphism between singular cohomology, which it tends up to C, and the wrong cohomology of X when you're over C. These two things become isomorphic. And not just that, but even more, you also have a corresponding statement at the level of sheaves, which is known as the Riemann-Hiller correspondence. There's no space to write this, but the statement at the vector space is also mirrored by a corresponding statement comparing sheave series between D modules and vector sheaves. So, right? Then the third example, this was Grothendieck's big realization in the finite cohomology, so this whole formalism of sites and so on was developed. So here, X lives over K, and L is any prime that's different from the characteristic of K. And then you have these cohomology groups, which you can either just take Z mod L coefficients, or you could also take Z mod L to the n-D coefficients. And again, there's also a corresponding sheave series, which takes any X to Grothendieck's category, which is also Z mod L to the n-D coefficients. And again, so what does this give you in this? Ah, one comment I wanted to make here is that if cohomology itself satisfies the credit formula, but if you are asking for this at the categorical level, then this actually does not satisfy the categorical formula. So it's not quite as nice as the other sheave series. And so in this picture, what does it give you? Well, when L is equal to 2, then this gives you a cohomology series as long as your geometry is not in characteristic 2. So you're on this line here, and you can't just do this mod 2, but also mod power, because there's some kind of slightly thickened line here.

And again, there's a corresponding at least fully facial functor at the level of sheaves, not quite an equivalence. And so for any prime, I can now draw this line, but you have to be careful not to cross, to omit the residue characteristic. And then... I've only found one more homologous here, known as a crystalline. Note that I'm omitting a horizontal line at infinity, and this one is still missing. This only works for usual primes, not theta-commediate primes. There's something called crystalline homology. So this is when x is over k, which is of characteristic p bigger than 0. And then you have this crystalline homology here. And at least if I invert p, then this has some good structure. So in particular, there's also some corresponding sheave theory. This took much longer to develop. There's work of B\u00e9atelot, Karou, and many people, and I'm not quite an expert on this drawing. But there's something called arithmetic D-modules on x. And for the versions that are in the literature, I'm not quite sure whether they would satisfy the categorical quantum formula. Maybe they do, maybe they don't, I just didn't check it. But I know that there are versions of this construction, which might not exactly agree with the things that are in the literature, but which do satisfy this categorical quantum formula. So a few years ago, I gave a talk at Darmstadt, where I explained one possibility for such a formula. And so when you're in characteristic 2, this gives you something that's defined to anything. So it's taking this up in a vertical fiber game, because your elementary needs to stay in characteristic 2, or characteristic 3, or characteristic 5, or whatever. Let me put my file so I can watch the right picture. So these things are, this is this one.

    "content": "So this is where things stood for a while. But then I already roughly raised this question that now the situation at p, p in this picture seems quite confusing. There's a lot of different cohomology series that come together there. So when you just zoom in there, you can see that there's a lot of different cohomologies. And then you have crystalline cohomology, the wrong cohomology, and it's also homology somewhere else here. So mathematically speaking, when you have a scheme that lives in this characteristic, so it's over zp, you have some of the crystalline cohomology of the special fiber of the zp, you have the wrong cohomology of x of the zp, and you have the top cohomology of x based on x to t bar of zp coefficients. There was a question, how are these related? This became the subject known as Kirchhoff's theory. So note that both the kind of how they are defined is very different, and the kind of structure that they have is very different. So for example, crystalline cohomology, this carries a Frobenius action because everything comes from characteristic p carries a Frobenius, so that means it's just acting on x. The wrong cohomology comes with this extra structure, which is a Hoth filtration. And this also has an extra structure, which is an action of the absolute power groups. Very different definition, very different structures, but suggested software that should really still fit into one framework. And so then at first Fontaine found some conjectural pictures of what's going on, so he formulated a sort of comparison of conjectures. How are these different things related? So for example, in this situation, my legs are proper and smooth. Fontaine would conjecture that if you take this crystalline cohomology and tend to it up to a certain ring known as B-crist, then it's isomorphic, sorry, to a tar cohomology, and then up to B-crist compatible with all the extra structures. So it turns out that B-crist summons all the three kinds of extra structures, so the Frobenius has a double action, it has a filtration, and so then by forming the tensor product, you get induced structures here, and similar on the other side. These conjectures were then successfully proved in particular by Foutings and Tsuji. And that's it.",

I think the picture got a bit clearer when there was one cohomology series introduced that really just specializes to all the others. Okay. Right, and so then there is not a... So here the X lives over a base ring during a divinities of K or something like this, where K is the characteristic of the field. So now I'm slightly deviating from my setting where I assume that X always lives over an algebraically closed field, but now I'm specifically interested in the kind of degeneration from characteristic 0 to characteristic P, so I also need to have a geometric object in the corresponding situation. And then there is something known as a prism for okay, and if you were in positive characteristics, an example would just be... I mean, then this would be just a perfect field of characteristic P little k, and this would be the bit vectors, and this would be the ideal generated by P. And once you have that, you can define something known as a prismatic cohomology, denoted by this prism symbol here. So this thing is something that compares to all the previous ones. That's the prism line and it's... And so pictorially, you're somehow filling in this whole diagram here with a prismatic cohomology. And so if I want to go back to this diagram that I can now feel that I kind of understand what's happening in all these blocks that people are seeing here, in a way that does connect this branch, this ethyl branch that was cut off here, is somehow connected to the picture again. Which, in particular, gives rise to interesting loops in this kind of picture that you can take, which I think have been used for lots of applications in some sense. Even just as a usual kind of getting much more conjectures. So now you have these blocks here. If you want, you can also draw something out about here, because this is somewhat about a theory of Hodge theory comparing many end-to-end cohomology, and then there's Hodge filtration on this, so there's this whole subject of the complex Hodge theory very well developed.

And you might think that there should be a way to combine all these different blocks here into something that covers everything here. This is very much related to what I said here. So this should cover the whole neighborhood of the diagonal. So there should be something that thickens up the diagonal in some way, making all the prismatic cohomology part of one thing. For the moment, I'm slightly confused about how to connect this Hodge series, so let me not quite connect it there yet. And as I said, this was somehow connecting the prismatic cohomology with Auri, connecting this into the C4 branch. In some sense, this new theory was slightly spread further out of the C4 branch. Not quite everywhere, but further than the prismatic cohomology was seen. So this log script here is supposed to be the central cohomology. So we're unifying quite a lot of different cohomology theories and more. And so what's the starting point for trying to find this theory? The starting point is an interesting example of such a prism. So there's something known as a Q-Garon prism. This is given by the ring A being equal to power 2 minus 2 minus 1. So this A is some kind of periodic complete ring, and it's also supposed to have the Frobenius vector in it. The Frobenius will just be the thing that tends Q to the power of Q. Kind of obvious Frobenius that we have here. And then this ideal I is a certain principle ideal. Let's find some properties. In this case it will just be the one generated by the Q-Diffimation of the element P. Or what is the Q-Diffimation for any integer n? This is Gaussian Q-Diffimation of an integer n, 1 minus Q to the n, or 1 minus Q, or 1 minus P. So this is a prism where the corresponding quotient, the thing about I, is you take this thing and mod it by the Q-Diffimation of P, also known as the P-Circuitomic Polynomial. So then you just get an extension of the Z-Division. In particular, for any variety X over this ring, you will have some spherical mod, and you can try to compute what this is. And just a spot for the mod. You can just try to see what you get. The background is some of the best.",

And so, and then you find that this is computed by Q-Diffimation of the Dirouin complex, the kind of obvious Q-Diffimation of the Dirouin complex. So you know there must be some kind of Q-Diffimation of the Dirouin complex just from these kind of comparisons that you have. Let's look at the specializations to the Dirouin complex logic. But then you compute it, you see that it's somewhat canonically computed by Q-Diffimation of the Dirouin complex. So you take the coordinate ring of your CFM line, so it has some coordinate X, and then you compute the joint, and then there is this Q-Diffimation of the differential, going back to the same thing. And when previously the derivative of X to the n is n times X n minus 1, you just Q-Diffimation this by putting Q-Diffimation of n. And in slightly more variant terms, if you have any function n of X here, then you're sending it here to this difference function f of Qx minus f of X divided by Qx minus X. But you don't take the limit as Q goes to 1. Q is somewhat close to 1, but you still retain the whole policy. And so I still remember very, very well when I first did this computation, actually we did this in the context of the A-Info logic, and I was just completely confused what the Q is doing there, and why Q-Diffimations appear. What are Q-Diffimations doing here? We really didn't ask for them. And until today I don't really understand what's going on, but I'm trying to understand this phenomenon better and better. So just to give an indication that something very strange is happening here. And this cohomology series is supposed to be factorial, of course, in automorphism in particular of your variety, so you can just change the coordinate X with some other coordinate, like 1 minus X, or X plus 1, or T minus 1 times X, or whatever. And then it must act on this cohomology because it's factorial. But if you try to write down in coordinates what this coordinate transformation does, it's totally unclear, because if you change the coordinate X, then the meaning of this Q-Difference quotient just changes completely, because the Q-Difference quotient is about the values of X and the Q times X. But if you don't take the limit as Q goes to 1, there's no Q times X, there's some random point somewhere else. This is automorphism of sending X times Q times X is not invariant under the coordinate transformations. So the very fact that the cohomology of this complex, or even the complex of the quasi-automorphism, is independent of the quasi-automorphism is not at all clear.",

The good news about this computation is that for this kind of quest of finding something that's uniform in P here, this Q-Difformation looks great, because there's an obvious way to write down such a complex that doesn't depend on P, it just removes the P everywhere. Except that there's somehow a piece with a unity, and there's also this Q-Difformation of P playing a little bit of a special role there, so actually if you look at the details of this, it becomes a bit confusing. But in first approximation, to form this Q to the round-context, the Q to the round-context is something that you can perfectly well do independently of P. And so I formulated some conjectures there. So this was already in 2015 already, it was published in 2017, in a paper called Canonical Q-Difirmation in Arithmetic. And one version of this conjecture says the following. So R is a smooth zero-round. Equipped. A smooth and a tile map. From spec R to some... I mean, locally any smooth map has a tile map to a definite space, and let me just work locally so that I can choose such a map. This is an image of R. And there is a cohomology theory for a proper smooth of varieties. Take the R. Taking values in a finely generated... So Q-Connection has two different modules, whatever you want to call this. So it's something where you don't... The operation of sending f of x to f of Q times x, or rather to f of Qx minus f of x over Qx minus x is all lifted to the module. And this requires knowing how to scale the coordinates by Q, but you have the coordinates here, this kind of automorphism, sending all the coordinates, multiplying them by Q, lift uniquely to spec R. Spec R equals Q minus 1. So, and the reduction in the module Q minus 1, So the specialization to Q equals 1. So when you specialize Q-Connection to Q equals 1, you just get a usual connection. And the specialization to Q equals 1 should just be the Durant cohomology of x over R with a Gauss-Mano connection. So in an insoluble sense, the algebraic variety is the Durant cohomology of...",

    "content": "So I'm saying in an insoluble sense, the algebraic variety is the Durant cohomology of the canonical Q-deformation, such that moreover the Gauss-Mano connection deforms to a canonical Q-Connection on this Q-Durant cohomology. So this thing that you hear is called the Durant cohomology of x over R. It's a very simple thing. And I'd like to do that. Do you have something like Q-Unit relation? Something like what? Like Q-Unit relation. Yeah, the Q-Unit formula holds it. And there should be some further structures of this. There should be some Frobenius operator and lots of things. I don't want to spell it out all here, but it is spelled out in this paper. And this is actually known, so this is a serum. So after Q-Unit completion, it is in my previous slide of patterned prismatic cohomology, so I give a slightly ahistorical account of the development, where prismatic cohomology was undergoing several stages of development. And early on we already observed this pre-deformation picture, and then made this conjecture, and later on it was developed enough so that it can really prove such a pre-deconfission. And in full it was done in the mass series of Petty and Wagner. I should say that this step is in some sense more or less formal, because you already know that after rationalization everything will just be a constant extension of the round cohomology. So rationally nothing interesting happens, and in some sense all the interesting stuff is happening theoretically where we have already constructed it. But making the technical details work is real work, and this was done. However, this idyllic gluing that you are doing here feels a little bit artificial. It can be made to work, but the pieces, they don't quite seem to fit together, and you can still make them fit together, but it is a little bit awkward. In particular, I'm not quite sure whether this idyllic gluing works well enough so that you could also make a series of coefficients out of this. I've never fully tried. So this cohomology sets only at the level of cohomology groups, and there hasn't been a real series of coefficients. In the prismatic series, there is a good series of coefficients that should have set. That would also satisfy a pretty good group. And probably one can also make it work here. Okay, so you get this canonical information, and this raises the obvious question, so let me give an example. So maybe the most favorite example is the Legendre family with the curves. So here, R seems to be zero to a lambda, and then you convert lambda to one minus lambda.",

    "content": "So here, R seems to be zero to a lambda, and then you convert lambda to one minus lambda. And X over R will be the elliptic curve. For safety, let me invert two, because I'm not quite sure what I'm doing here. So it's f i model, y squared equals x times x minus one times x minus one times lambda. So then the first round cohomology of X over R is three of rank two. And inside there, it has a hot fluctuation, right? So in particular, it has the first three hot fluctuations, which is global differentials. And there is actually some kind of canonical global differential omega, which is dx over y. So let's go to the other side. And let's have a correction. And so then omega and lambda omega, they form a basis. And the number squared of omega is, if I've copied it correctly, one over four times lambda minus two times omega plus two times lambda minus one times omega. So there's an obvious differential equation associated with this, if you look for horizontal solutions to this. So the horizontal section is, for example, some function f of lambda, and then one minus lambda here. For the hypergeometric function, for example, this Gauss-Manuel connection of the Kipchow-Fuchs equation in this case, the solutions to this are certain hypergeometric functions. And then you have some kind of canonical coefficients here. So this is near some lambda equal to zero, where this equation has regular singularity, so I multiply by some lambdas here to get rid of some singularities. This has a certain power series solution, which happens to be a hypergeometric function. And well, these were things I knew at the time, but then I also knew that there is this thing called Q-hypergeometric functions, which are things that satisfy Q-difference equations. And then some of the question was arising, whether these known Q-difference equations, these known Q-hypergeometric functions have anything to do with these Q-difference equations of the round-common.",
