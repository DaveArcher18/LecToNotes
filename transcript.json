And the modified version was just given by modified version. And then using this, we define first some complexes. So this was a Q to run complex. It's just the obvious version of the ROM complex, where you replace the derivatives by these Q derivatives. And also a Q host complex, where you do the same thing with these modified versions here. And we also, this just gives us some complex vector space, but we also defined categories refining this in some sense. And these were the category of Q connections. Modified Q connections. So these were just modules equipped with similar analogs. This is Q derivative operation satisfying the obvious version of. And let me make some corrections last time. Or one correction, really.

Um and then I finally support on the third formula that this is this plus you would like to write identity tender um tender the q connection on n, but the square square somehow observed that just like um this q derivative is closely related to this operation gamma i by this formula.

The q-derivative is defined using an automorphism \u03b3_i, which acts on functions by multiplying the i-th coordinate by q. The motivation for this definition is that applying the q-derivative to t^n yields the q-analog of the derivative of t^n. The modified q-derivative is a variant of this concept. These derivatives are used to define q-de Rham complexes and q-Hochschild complexes, which are analogs of the de Rham and Hochschild complexes with q-derivatives replacing ordinary derivatives. The segment also introduces categories of q-connections and modified q-connections, which are modules equipped with q-derivative operations satisfying certain conditions. A correction is made regarding the symmetric power functions, and the relationship between q-derivatives and the operation \u03b3_i is highlighted.\n\n2. Added motivation: These concepts are foundational in the study of q-analogs in mathematics, which are generalizations of classical mathematical objects that incorporate a parameter q. The q-derivatives and associated complexes provide a framework for exploring deformations of classical calculus and algebraic structures, which are important in areas such as quantum groups, combinatorics, and mathematical physics. The categories of q-connections and modified q-connections refine these ideas by introducing module structures that are compatible with the q-derivative operations, allowing for a deeper understanding of the algebraic properties of q-analogs.\n```"

So, and another thing is that at the end of the last lecture, somebody asked me whether there's a notion of q honor connections. And there is actually a theory of q honor connections twice a little bit of some close a lot and minus three houses. And this kind of q holonomicity condition also appears a lot in the stuff about Chinese invariance. These are also q polynomials. Q honomicity. So there's a paper of ADAS and the but summarizing this sort of Q honority. Alright. So to simplify my life today, I will always assume that's invertible.

So logarithmic derivatives in general sense will just be T I is empty actual derivative and similarly I also decide this is the same formula for that sorry as long as T i is invertible some of these are similar information.

The speaker notes that for rational connections, the introduction of `Q`-information does not significantly alter the structure, as it merely introduces a scaling factor. However, the speaker emphasizes that the theoretical study of `q`-deformations is much richer and more complex. The discussion then shifts to the importance of considering completions, particularly in the context of `q`-deformations, and the challenges associated with operators in this setting. The speaker suggests that the course will focus on a more comprehensive approach to `q`-deformations, moving beyond the simple case of `q - 1` completions.\n\n2. **Added motivation:** The study of `q`-deformations and their completions is crucial for understanding the behavior of geometric objects under deformations or completions, particularly in the setting of `q`-analogs and non-commutative geometry. The reduction modulo `q - 1` and the resulting identity endomorphism are key technical tools in algebraic geometry and deformation theory, ensuring that extensions of automorphisms are well-behaved in a formal neighborhood. This property is fundamental for constructing and analyzing `q`-deformations of classical geometric and algebraic structures, and is particularly relevant in the study of `q`-analogs in combinatorics and mathematical physics. The assumption of invertibility of `T_i` is a common simplification in the study of `q`-analogs, allowing for a more straightforward derivation of key results and relationships.\n```"

And this is something we can do when things are in general because we can always live long. But if say q is piece group unity, then well I mean this operation of multiplier p p unity is still some kind of physically moving things around. This needs not work for example in the very stupid example x is going to be something extremely simple like just an open subset n minus one then if you want to lift this automorphism then x would have to be stable under multiplication but the open subset x would have to be stable under gamma i but it just isn't this fucking physical number anymore. Also, when I wrote my paper, you know, give you the connections, I suppose. Using coordinates, this is difficult to extens, but I was somewhat trying something to the point. Anyone just to do something slightly confusing. So, to get inspired for the correct thing, we know that is close to one period. And so, we can try to understand the and because there's more value right now and there is no real increased complexity in server variables, I'm just uh so so then we have okay, so we use the topic, and we can also have command so so we can take this picture and specialize to people to set up in so then.",
