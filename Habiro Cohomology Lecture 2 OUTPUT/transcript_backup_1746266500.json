Which should be some module, or a graded module, for a value array, but really we would like to have something really more. So when I discussed cohomology series last time, I was emphasising that each of these really also comes with some category of coefficients, or constructable sheaves, or something. So we would also have some kind of, I don't know what to call this, but some kind of derived category. And for lack of a better name, I would prefer to use these as variations for a Neurohomus structure, but some kind of derived category associated to NEX, giving you the sheave series for this notion of a Neurohomology. And what I would like to start with in this first video lecture is to explain what these structures should be in coordinates. And it turns out that if you choose coordinates on X, these things have very simple definitions, and the whole mystery is why these objects turn out to be independent of the choice of coordinates. And in fact, so what I mean by coordinates... ...named a tau map. So locally, any smooth scheme admits a tau map to a defined space. And I'd like to also have to map a framing of X, and in some parts of algebraic numbers theory, it has become traditional to denote framings by a box symbol. Let me make the remark right now that the formulas often become simpler if you assume that the coordinates ti are invertible on X, and I will often make the simplifying assumptions. And again, locally on X, this can always be achieved.",

And then, in the next step, we will see how to extend the discussion from just the space changes and get the tau over it. But on the first part, let's really just focus on the simplification. And so, one thing that happens in this case is that we don't actually have to do any completions. In this case, we can somehow define what is a spherical model. I do not want to make any claims, and something definitely false, that this would be independent of coordinates, but at least if you choose coordinates, you would be able to write it down. So, let's get started. So, we have these two derivatives. Which go from the i, which refers to an index, that's one of the coordinates, and goes from the algebra that we're working with, but you join q. And what does it do? Well, it's basically the same formula as for the derivative, except you have to define it just to define it as a monomial. So, you take product x1 to the n1, so xe to the nv, and well, usually you would get x1 to the n1, and then for xi you take 1, and then e to the nv, and you multiply by ni, and for this q derivative, simply q to the 4. Where, I recall that since there's a q-deformation of any integer n, 1 minus q to the n is 1 minus q. So, this is a different, more close to one formula for what this q derivative is, except if you apply it to a function of x.",

In this case, completions are not necessary, and a spherical model can be defined, although its coordinate-independence is not claimed. The discussion revolves around two derivatives, which map from an index i (referring to an algebra) to q. The q-derivative is defined as a monomial, similar to the standard derivative formula, but with q^4 instead of ni. The q-deformation of an integer n is recalled, where 1 - q^n is equal to 1 - q: these concepts are crucial in understanding the q-derivative's application to functions of x.\n\nAdded motivation: The study of q-derivatives and their relationship with standard derivatives, is essential in the broader mathematical context of algebraic combinatorics and representation theory.

It's the same way you take f of these things, but ci you multiply by q, and then you subtract the volume at the original spot. And then you divide by the different doses. And so you immediately see that this nabla iq is closely related. So, the automorphism gamma i from x to x, which sends any tj to either tj, where tj is not equal to i, but in coordinate i, multiplied by t. So, this gamma i of x is equal to iq. So, some basic facts about these q derivatives are that the nabla iq, they commute. However, be aware that they do not satisfy the Leibniz rule, since they satisfy a certain q-deformation of the Leibniz rule. So, if you apply it to a product, then you would expect that it's f times the q derivative of g, plus g times the q derivative of f. But that's not true, it's not a derivation. Instead, you need to put gamma i in one of these terms, and you're somehow free to choose where. So, this q-deformation of the Leibniz rule in particular breaks the symmetry a little bit, because this side was obviously asymmetric in f and g, this side doesn't look like it's symmetric. All right, let's see right now. And so, using this you can then write down a q-deformation of the Sideron complex.

And when you work on GM, it's actually better to take these logarithmic derivatives of Ti as your basis formula one. And so that's one reason that it's sometimes easier to do computation of the Ti invertible, because then you can even forget about this division by Ti. Okay. So why is this called the Q-H complex? If you specialize the Q.1, well first of all the Q to the round complex just becomes the round complex because Q to the root is specialized to the Q to the root of Ti. And sometimes the Q-H complex specializes just to the H complex, which is really just the direct sum of X. If you set Q equal to one here, then all the differences are just zero. So you really just get the direct sum of all these different groups. And you're supposed to think of these as things in degree i's. Okay, so this is supposed to explain the terminology.
