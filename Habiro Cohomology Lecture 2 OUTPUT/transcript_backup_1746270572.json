Which should be some module, or a graded module, for a value array, but really we would like to have something really more. So when I discussed cohomology series last time, I was emphasising that each of these really also comes with some category of coefficients, or constructable sheaves, or something. So we would also have some kind of, I don't know what to call this, but some kind of derived category. And for lack of a better name, I would prefer to use these as variations for a Neurohomus structure, but some kind of derived category associated to NEX, giving you the sheave series for this notion of a Neurohomology. And what I would like to start with in this first video lecture is to explain what these structures should be in coordinates. And it turns out that if you choose coordinates on X, these things have very simple definitions, and the whole mystery is why these objects turn out to be independent of the choice of coordinates. And in fact, so what I mean by coordinates... ...named a tau map. So locally, any smooth scheme admits a tau map to a defined space. And I'd like to also have to map a framing of X, and in some parts of algebraic numbers theory, it has become traditional to denote framings by a box symbol. Let me make the remark right now that the formulas often become simpler if you assume that the coordinates ti are invertible on X, and I will often make the simplifying assumptions. And again, locally on X, this can always be achieved.",

And then, in the next step, we will see how to extend the discussion from just the space changes and get the tau over it. But on the first part, let's really just focus on the simplification. And so, one thing that happens in this case is that we don't actually have to do any completions. In this case, we can somehow define what is a spherical model. I do not want to make any claims, and something definitely false, that this would be independent of coordinates, but at least if you choose coordinates, you would be able to write it down. So, let's get started. So, we have these two derivatives. Which go from the i, which refers to an index, that's one of the coordinates, and goes from the algebra that we're working with, but you join q. And what does it do? Well, it's basically the same formula as for the derivative, except you have to define it just to define it as a monomial. So, you take product x1 to the n1, so xe to the nv, and well, usually you would get x1 to the n1, and then for xi you take 1, and then e to the nv, and you multiply by ni, and for this q derivative, simply q to the 4. Where, I recall that since there's a q-deformation of any integer n, 1 minus q to the n is 1 minus q. So, this is a different, more close to one formula for what this q derivative is, except if you apply it to a function of x.",

In this case, completions are not necessary, and a spherical model can be defined, although its coordinate-independence is not claimed. The discussion revolves around two derivatives, which map from an index i (referring to an algebra) to q. The q-derivative is defined as a monomial, similar to the standard derivative formula, but with q^4 instead of ni. The q-deformation of an integer n is recalled, where 1 - q^n is equal to 1 - q: these concepts are crucial in understanding the q-derivative's application to functions of x.\n\nAdded motivation: The study of q-derivatives and their relationship with standard derivatives, is essential in the broader mathematical context of algebraic combinatorics and representation theory.

It's the same way you take f of these things, but ci you multiply by q, and then you subtract the volume at the original spot. And then you divide by the different doses. And so you immediately see that this nabla iq is closely related. So, the automorphism gamma i from x to x, which sends any tj to either tj, where tj is not equal to i, but in coordinate i, multiplied by t. So, this gamma i of x is equal to iq. So, some basic facts about these q derivatives are that the nabla iq, they commute. However, be aware that they do not satisfy the Leibniz rule, since they satisfy a certain q-deformation of the Leibniz rule. So, if you apply it to a product, then you would expect that it's f times the q derivative of g, plus g times the q derivative of f. But that's not true, it's not a derivation. Instead, you need to put gamma i in one of these terms, and you're somehow free to choose where. So, this q-deformation of the Leibniz rule in particular breaks the symmetry a little bit, because this side was obviously asymmetric in f and g, this side doesn't look like it's symmetric.

And when you work on GM, it's actually better to take these logarithmic derivatives of Ti as your basis formula one. And so that's one reason that it's sometimes easier to do computation of the Ti invertible, because then you can even forget about this division by Ti. Okay. So why is this called the Q-H complex?

The proposition also involves the Wolfson's gamma i's, which reduce to the identity and preserve the sum of all.\n\nAdded motivation: This result has significant implications for the study of algebraic geometry and representation theory. The lecturer's careful construction of a modified connection and tangent sheds light on the intricate relationships between modules and connections, and has important consequences for the study of algebraic K-theory and topological invariants. Understanding these concepts is crucial in advancing research in these areas, and the lecture's focus on resolving the technical issues is a vital step in this direction."

And so the question is, what extent are these modules rather strange? So let's look at the case where X is just GM to the D. Then for generic Q, these modules modify Q connection. They're really some kind of pros and cons on GM mod Q to the D. Because this gamma i's act by multiplication by Q on the coordinates. And then this data of these endomorphisms, it would really give you just a descent to this kind of quotient stack here. But ... I mean, we want that this can be somewhat It's functorial in any possible maps of X and also like if you pass to open subsets of Q. So what is this object? GM going by Q to Z. What kind of object? I mean, I'm probably just thinking about this as the FPQC quotient of GM by the action of Q to the Z. I'm not sure it's so helpful to think of this as a geometric object.

So ... maybe I don't want to continue this discussion right now because there are only 15 minutes left. I should maybe rather do something, explain something else in the remaining few minutes. So, prior to today I told you about two things associated to X. One kind of cohomology is the round complex or the QH complex. And then about some categories. Actually, the category knows about the cohomology. So, to hear the propositions. So, the QH complex computes the direct and the morphisms of the unit in the direct category. And the QH complex. So, the QH complex computes the unit in the direct category. So, the problem with this is the thing I said previously that these things have canonical, derived commutative ring structures. Because whenever you have any kind of symmetric monoidal category, then the morphisms of the unit become an infinity. Sorry, is it clear that these subcategories are also stable or derived, or triangulated? These subcategories. Because you take all Z adjoining Q plus minus one T underscore modules, you consider the sub-objects which have Q connection. No, I mean, I literally take the BN category of modules with such a sub-Q connection and then I take the raw categories. But I know that this subcategory of modules is still a BN. It's not a subcategory, right? Because sub-Q connection has a lot of extra data. But yeah, I think it's quite reasonably BN category, right? So, if you have a map of these things, it must be kernel, core kernel, and whatnot. It again has these two connection structures.",

    "content": "This map is sent to zero, right? Because here one goes to one, and this map is induced by the basis vector here, so it's a module action. But if you take the Q derivative of one, this ends up being zero. And you can check that multiplication by number Q in this ring is injective. Because, for example, in the associated array, you just get this bunch of Q commuting variables. So, this is injective, and you check that the quotient is precisely just for moments in Q, because whenever you have some element that has some number Qs inside them, then using this relation, you can move them to the left or right, I don't know. And then there's someone's image of this map. So, you have this two-step re-resolution of this module we care about, and then you just take the R from this thing into this guy. And so, this computes the R here in terms of what you get for this re-resolution. That's okay. When the free guy is in, you just get the module. And then this number Q just realizes the image. Oh, great. I think that is maybe a good time to stop. So, let's stop there. Questions? I have a question. This reversal, what is getting reversed? I mean, you need to find some isomorphism between M and N. Some of the order of M and N get reversed, right? This is not the obvious, like underlying modules is not the obvious symmetric. But you can just figure it out by reverse engineering. The obvious symmetric model structure you have on these modified Q connections, and you treat them as C, C, and N, and R. Do you remember the data that you mentioned? Yes, I think I wrote down the title. Okay. Let me not try my French. I'm going from this usual connection to Q connections. One can also say that you are going from differential equations to difference equations, because instead of having a formula for the derivative of F, suddenly you have an equation for this.",

But then there are also some subtleties, and the most important ones only being the differentials are a very local thing. Whereas, if you have a formula for the derivative of F, suddenly you have an equation for the difference of the value of F at 2 times T, and the value of F at T. So, you describe these actual differences instead of the differential. So, a lot of the stuff that works for differential equations and so on, also works for difference equations, but then also some subtleties. So, the most important ones only being the differentials are a very local thing, whereas differences are obviously normal. So, you wrote in the definition that you have less Q connection. Right. So, the status just amounts to the commuting property. Ah, okay. Thanks. We could see there was some reasonable holonomic modules subcategory. Probably. Yeah, I would guess one can define some kind of energy non-experiment, so that we don't try to comment on it. So, certainly when you're close to the root of unity, I would expect that there is some kind of notion of complexity for these things. I'm not quite sure about that. Like, one way to think about holonomicity is that you want your modules to, I mean, you have a module of this kind of noncommutative algebra, and you would basically like to have some kind of filtration on the module lifting the kind of degree filtration for these operators, so that when you pass through the associated graded, then you get, I mean, usually you get some module of this commutative algebra, in like 2D variables, and you would like this thing to be a grand chief of dimension at most D. But now you get these Q commuting operators. And so... Well, when you use the root of unity, then this thing still has a very large center, and then you could still make the same admission, and it has non-dimensional support. Yeah, so in general, I'm not quite sure how the dimension theory would work. It was a still noncommutative ring. Other questions? Qx is one-dimensional. What are the random portion of homologues? If you compute the homology of this complex? Yes. I mean, sure. So next time, I want to start investigating the extent to which the sub-neural homologues are independent of coordinates, so I will start computing this a little bit. Okay. Qx is a1, and we're just looking at this complex. And we take this modified curve, so that it sends p to be equal to q to the n-1, times 2 to the n minus 1, basically. And so, well, the h0 would just be c. And the h1 would be the direct sum over all 10 to the n equal to 1 of a1 minus q to the n. Right? Because each degree somehow gives you, you don't quite hit everything, you only hit the things that are divisible by 1 minus q to the n. And so you get this large module supported at root subunit.
