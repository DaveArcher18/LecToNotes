# Improvement Plan for get_transcript.py

## 1. Audio Preprocessing and Whisper Optimization

### 1.1 Audio Preprocessing
- Implement noise reduction using librosa or scipy to clean the audio before processing
- Add voice normalization to adjust audio levels for more consistent transcription
- Implement a silence detection and removal step to improve processing speed
- Add option for audio speed adjustment (0.9-1.1x) for better recognition of technical terms

### 1.2 Whisper Configuration Improvements
- Update to use the latest Whisper API with optimal settings
- Add support for beam search with beam size of 5 for better accuracy
- Implement a word-level timestamps option for more precise segmentation
- Configure proper language detection or force English for academic content
- Enable proper temperature settings (0.0 for deterministic output)
- Add a comprehensive list of technical terms to the initial_prompt:
  - Mathematics: cohomology, Habiro, prismatic, crystalline, sheaves, Grothendieck, etc.
  - Specialized terms found in lecture videos

### 1.3 Context Window Optimization
- Implement overlapping segments for transcription (5-minute chunks with 10-second overlap)
- Pass the previous segment's transcript as context for the next segment
- Create a specialized WhisperContext.txt file with key terms and expressions
- Train a custom word list for the specific mathematical domain terms

### 1.4 Repetition Detection and Cleanup
- Implement post-processing to detect and eliminate repetitive phrases
- Create a pattern recognition system to catch "echo patterns" like seen in transcript.json
- Use text similarity metrics to identify and merge repeated sentences
- Add validation to ensure logical flow between sentences

## 2. Summary Generation

### 2.1 Summary Structure
- Create an information-rich first paragraph focused on content details
- Generate an "Added motivation" second paragraph explaining why the content matters
- Ensure summaries include key terms, concepts, and their relationships
- Follow academic tone but maintain readability and clarity

### 2.2 Sliding Context Window
- Implement a sliding context window system that provides previous summaries as context
- Structure prompt to encourage coherent progression across summaries
- Add a "themes so far" tracking mechanism to ensure consistency
- Integrate cross-references to previously mentioned concepts

### 2.3 Summary Generation Integration
- Create a new field "summary" in transcript.json for each entry
- Use Groq/OpenAI API for generating summaries with appropriate prompts
- Add retry logic with backoff for API failures
- Implement parallel processing for summary generation to improve speed

### 2.4 Incremental Saving
- Add a checkpoint system to save progress after each segment is processed
- Ensure transcript.json is updated immediately after each segment is transcribed
- Implement a resume feature to continue from the last successfully processed segment
- Add integrity checks to ensure JSON validity after each update

## 3. Implementation Details

### 3.1 Code Structure
- Refactor `get_transcript.py` into modular components:
  - AudioProcessor: handles all audio preprocessing
  - TranscriptionEngine: interfaces with Whisper API
  - SummaryGenerator: handles summary creation
  - PersistenceManager: handles file saving and recovery

### 3.2 Command Line Interface
- Add flexible CLI options:
  - `--preprocess-only`: Just clean the audio without transcribing
  - `--summarize-only`: Generate summaries for existing transcriptions
  - `--chunk-size`: Customize the length of each segment (default: 5 minutes)
  - `--quality`: Select transcription quality level (balanced/accuracy/speed)
  - `--context-file`: Specify custom context file

### 3.3 Progress Tracking
- Implement a progress bar using tqdm
- Add detailed logging with timestamps for each processing stage
- Create a summary report after completion with quality metrics

### 3.4 Error Handling
- Add comprehensive error handling at each processing stage
- Implement automatic recovery from API failures
- Create a diagnostic mode for debugging transcription issues
- Add validation for each output to ensure quality

## Implementation Timeline

1. **Week 1**: Audio preprocessing and Whisper optimization
2. **Week 2**: Summary generation implementation
3. **Week 3**: Integration, testing, and refinement

## Success Metrics

- Reduction in word error rate by at least 30%
- Elimination of repetitive phrases
- Complete and accurate technical term transcription
- Informative summaries that capture key concepts
- Robust error recovery
