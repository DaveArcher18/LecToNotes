# Session Handoff: Transcript Processing and Dashboard Improvements

## Improvements Made

### 1. Enhanced Transcript Processing (`get_transcript.py`)

We completely overhauled the transcript generation pipeline with the following improvements:

- **Audio Preprocessing**: Added robust audio preprocessing using librosa to improve transcription quality:
  - Noise reduction and normalization
  - Silence removal
  - High-pass filtering for better speech clarity

- **Improved Whisper Configuration**:
  - Higher sampling rate (48kHz) for better audio quality
  - Beam search with multiple candidates for more accurate transcription
  - Better context handling with specialized terms in WhisperContext.txt

- **Context Window Optimization**:
  - Added overlapping segments (5-minute chunks with 10-second overlap)
  - Previous transcript context passed to next segment
  - Comprehensive mathematical terms dictionary created

- **Repetition Detection and Removal**:
  - Automatic detection and elimination of repetitive phrases that appeared in previous transcripts
  - Pattern recognition for "echo patterns" commonly seen in lengthy academic lectures
  - Text similarity metrics to identify and clean up repeated content

- **Automatic Summary Generation**:
  - Added capability to generate information-rich summaries for each 5-minute segment
  - Two-paragraph structure: content details + added motivation
  - Sliding context window that provides previous summaries as context
  - Incremental saving for robustness against API failures

- **Improved CLI Interface**:
  - Added `--summarize-only` option to generate summaries for existing transcripts
  - Support for customizing chunk size and overlap
  - Better error handling and progress reporting

### 2. Dashboard UI Improvements (`dashboard/src/components/TranscriptViewer.jsx`)

Enhanced the dashboard to display the new transcript summaries:

- **Dual View Mode**:
  - Added toggle between transcript and summary views
  - Clean, intuitive interface with clear labeling
  - Improved content organization

- **Improved Styling**:
  - Better formatting for summaries with distinct styling
  - Enhanced readability with proper spacing and typography
  - Visually distinct summary blocks with border highlights

- **User Experience Improvements**:
  - Copy functionality for both transcripts and summaries
  - Preserved scrolling position when switching between views
  - Responsive design that works on different screen sizes

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**:
   - Test the transcript generation on different lecture videos
   - Verify summary quality across different mathematical topics
   - Check transcript accuracy with subject matter experts

2. **Further Enhancements**:
   - Consider adding text-to-speech capabilities for accessibility
   - Implement keyword extraction for easier navigation
   - Add support for multi-language lectures with automatic translation

3. **Integration with LLM_OCR.py**:
   - Ensure consistent formatting between blackboard OCR and transcript
   - Consider joint summarization that combines both transcript and blackboard content
   - Implement cross-references between transcript segments and relevant blackboards

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Profile the transcription pipeline for bottlenecks
   - Implement parallel processing for faster summary generation
   - Add caching for previously processed segments

5. **User Feedback**:
   - Gather feedback on summary quality and usefulness
   - Adjust summary format based on user preferences
   - Consider adding different summary lengths (short/medium/detailed)

## Documentation

The updated implementation follows the best practices outlined in the TODO.md file. The key components are:

1. `get_transcript.py`: Main script for audio extraction, preprocessing, transcription, and summary generation
2. `WhisperContext.txt`: Context file with specialized mathematical terms for better transcription
3. `dashboard/src/components/TranscriptViewer.jsx`: Updated component for displaying transcripts and summaries
4. `dashboard/src/components/TranscriptViewer.css`: Styling for the transcript and summary display

To generate summaries for an existing transcript without re-transcribing:
```
python get_transcript.py --summarize-only --out transcript.json
```

To process a new video with all enhancements:
```
python get_transcript.py video_file.mp4 --use-groq --out transcript.json
```
