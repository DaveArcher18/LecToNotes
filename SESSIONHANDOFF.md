## Summary of Changes

### 1. Updates to `get_boards.py`
- **Enhanced Board Detection**: Improved detection with perspective correction and multiple edge detection parameters.
- **Image Enhancement**: Added an option to enhance images for better OCR results using CLAHE.
- **Adaptive Frame Sampling**: Implemented intelligent frame sampling based on video length, configurable via the `--sampling-rate` option.
- **Quality Settings**: Introduced a `--quality` option (high/medium/low) to adjust JPEG quality and thresholds for deduplication.
- **Progress Tracking**: Added progress bars using `tqdm` for better user feedback during processing.
- **Pre-Optimized OCR Images**: Added a `--preoptimize-ocr` option to create and save pre-optimized images in a pickle file for use by `LLM_OCR.py`.
- **Path Handling**: Fixed path storage in `boards.json` to use relative filenames, ensuring compatibility with other tools.

### 2. Updates to `LLM_OCR.py`
- **Improved Path Handling**: Enhanced logic to handle image paths more robustly, including fallback strategies for missing images.
- **Error Handling**: Added error messages to the JSON output instead of skipping entries, ensuring progress is saved even when errors occur.
- **Integration with Pre-Optimized Images**: Adjusted the script to utilize pre-optimized images from the pickle file created by `get_boards.py`.

## Next Steps
1. **Testing the New `LLM_OCR.py`**:
   - Run the updated `LLM_OCR.py` with the new `boards.json` generated by the latest `get_boards.py`:
     ```bash
     python LLM_OCR.py boards/boards.json
     ```

2. **Verify Output**:
   - Check the output for any errors or warnings.
   - Ensure that the `boards.json` file is correctly populated with the `text` field for each board entry.

3. **Review Results**:
   - Validate the LaTeX output generated by the OCR process.
   - Confirm that the pre-optimized images are being utilized effectively.

4. **Further Testing**:
   - If any issues arise, troubleshoot the specific areas in either script.
   - Consider running additional test videos to ensure robustness across different scenarios.

5. **Documentation**:
   - Update any relevant documentation to reflect the changes made and the new usage instructions for both scripts.
